"""
This object resolves the issue of looking up different objects based on their indexes. 
It helps to avoid useless circular dependencies. 

For example, a workers needs to instantiate a KVCache object, while internally KVCache managed need to know how to generate 
  KVCEVents and send to the worker -> Router. 

This can also be used to lookup from id -> worker, so that we do not have to pass around internal router "queues" to a worker 

It is up to the implementation to keep these registries up-to-date
